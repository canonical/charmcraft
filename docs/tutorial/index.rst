Tutorial
========

Our tutorial comes in multiple flavours -- pick your flavour of choice!

.. note::

    Currently all our tutorial flavours demonstrate ``charmcraft`` in combination
    with an 12-factor app extension -- a journey that does not require any
    `ops <Operator framework>`_ and which does not currently include publishing the charm. To get a sense of the workflow for other types of applications and including the publication step, see :ref:`manage-charms`.
