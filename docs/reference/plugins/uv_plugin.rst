uv plugin
=========

The uv plugin is designed for Python charms that use `uv`_ as the build system
and are written with the `Operator framework`_.

How it works
------------

During the build step, the plugin performs the following actions:

#. It creates a virtual environment in the
   :ref:`${CRAFT_PART_INSTALL}/venv <craft_parts_step_execution_environment>`
   directory.
#. It runs :command:`uv sync` to install the packages referenced in the
   :file:`pyproject.toml` and :file:`uv.lock` files, along with any optional
   groups or extras specified.
#. It copies any existing :file:`src` and :file:`lib` directories from your
   charm project into the final charm.

Example
-------

The following :file:`charmcraft.yaml` file can be used with a uv project to
craft a charm with Ubuntu 24.04 as its base:

.. literalinclude:: uv-charmcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml
