# Charmcraft -- easily initialise, pack, and publish your charms

Charmcraft is a CLI tool that makes it easy and quick to initialise, package, and publish Kubernetes and machine charms. It is an official component of the Charm SDK, itself a part of [the Juju universe](https://juju.is/).

## Give it a try

Let's use Charmcraft to initialise and pack a Kubernetes charm:

### Set up

> See [Charm SDK | Set up your development environment automatically > Set up an Ubuntu `charm-dev` VM with Multipass](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/dev-setup#heading--automatic-set-up-an-ubuntu-charm-dev-vm-with-multipass). <br> Choose the MicroK8s track. 

### Initialise and pack your charm

In your Multipass VM shell, create a charm directory and use Charmcraft to initialise your charm file structure:

```
mkdir my-new-charm
cd my-new-charm
charmcraft init
```

This has created a standard charm directory structure:

```
$ ls -R
.:
CONTRIBUTING.md  README.md        pyproject.toml    src    tox.ini
LICENSE          charmcraft.yaml  requirements.txt  tests

./src:
charm.py

./tests:
integration  unit

./tests/integration:
test_charm.py

./tests/unit:
test_charm.py
```

Poke around: 

Note that the `charmcraft.yaml` file shows that what we have is an example charm called `my-new-charm`, which builds on Ubuntu 22.04 and which uses an OCI image resource `httpbin` from `kennethreitz/httpbin`.

Note that the `src/charm.py` file contains code scaffolding featuring the Charm SDK's Ops library for writing charms.

Explore further, start editing the files, or skip ahead and pack the charm: 

```
charmcraft pack
```

If you didn't take any wrong turn or simply left the charm exactly as it was, this should work and yield a file called `my-new-charm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm` (the architecture bit may be different depending on your system's architecture). Use this name and the resource from the `metadata.yaml` to deploy your example charm to your local MicroK8s cloud with Juju:

```
juju deploy ./my-new-charm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm --resource httpbin-image=kennethreitz/httpbin
```

Congratulations, youâ€™ve just initialised and packed your first Kubernetes charm using Charmcraft!

But Charmcraft goes far beyond `init` and `pack`. For example, when you're ready to share your charm with the world, you can use Charmcraft to publish your charm on Charmhub. Run `charmcraft help` to preview more.
