X.Y.Z (2024-MM-DD)

The charm plugin will now force-install pip if the installed venv version is older
than the minimum version, guaranteeing that pip gets updated correctly.

3.2.0 (2024-08-28)

The most notable under-the-hood work is that Charmcraft now uses pydantic 2.

Core

use for running a kubernetes charm.

Documentation
=============

The changelog is now included in the Charmcraft documentation. For completeness, we've
back-filled the log with all the important changes from previous releases documented
on GitHub.

For a complete list of commits, see the `3.2.0`_ release on GitHub.

3.1.2 (2024-08-07)
------------------

* fix(app): clarify wording on 'prime' change
* fix(strict-deps): fail if venv is inconsistent
* fix(application): exclude files from charm
* fix(package): Limit the bases in manifest.yaml


3.1.1 (2024-07-24)
------------------

* fix(ci): fix tox ensure_version_matches
* fix(metadata): allow long summaries in output
* tests(spread): temporarily disable failing test


3.1.0 (2024-07-23)
------------------

New Features
============

* Charmcraft has a new :ref:`ref_commands_fetch-libs` command, which, when
  combined with a ``charm-libs`` key in ``charmcraft.yaml``, allows the
  automatic fetching and updating of multiple
  `charm libraries <https://juju.is/docs/sdk/manage-libraries>`_.
* The new, experimental :ref:`ref_commands_test` command is also included in
  Charmcraft 3.1. Please have a go with it. Documentation is fairly minimal
  right now, as the implementation is still in flux.
* The :ref:`ref_commands_upload-resource` command now uses
  `skopeo <https://github.com/containers/skopeo>`_ to upload images. Most notably,
  this means you can enter
  `any skopeo-supported containers-transports URL
  <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/containers-transports.5.html>`_
  to upload an OCI container to Charmhub.
* New features to experimental
  `extensions <https://juju.is/docs/sdk/manage-extensions>`_:
  ``django-framework`` and ``flask-framework``. These are designed to work with rocks,
  for example, `rocks with the flask-framework extension`_.
* New releases are automatically published to PyPI (thanks @bittner)!

Bug fixes
=========

* flask-framework charms now automatically include the ``rustup`` snap
* Symlinked directories are correctly included in charms (previously only symlinked
  files worked).
* Fixed a crash when using the ``framework`` linter with the ``reactive`` plugin
* ... and several more!

For a complete list of commits, see the `3.1.0`_ release on GitHub.

  ``platforms`` keywords.
