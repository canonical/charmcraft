title: Strict dependencies test charm
summary: a test charm for checking strict dependency build failures.
description: |
  This charm fails to build because it has strict dependencies enabled and
  explicitly adds a `charm-python-packages` entry. The strict dependencies flag
  removes the ability to use `charm-python-packages`, requiring the packages to
  be included in a requirements file instead. (requirements.txt is implicitly
  included if no `charm-requirements` is specified.)
