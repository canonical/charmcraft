summary: Charmcraft supports Kubernetes operator development and collaboration
license: Apache-2.0
description: |
  Charmcraft enables collaboration between operator developers, and
  publication on Charmhub.io, home of the Open Operator Collection.

  Use `charmcraft` to:

   * Init a new charm file structure
   * Build your Kubernetes operator charm package
   * Register your charm name on Charmhub
   * Upload your charm to Charmhub
   * Release your charm into channels

  You can use charmcraft with operators written in any language but we
  recommend the Python Operator Framework from https://pypi.org/project/ops/
  developed at https://github.com/canonical/operator for ease of development
  and collaboration.

  Charmcraft and the Python Operator Framework extend the operator pattern
  beyond Kubernetes with universal operators that drive Linux apps. The universal
  operator pattern is very exciting for multi-cloud application management.
