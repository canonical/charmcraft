Write your first Kubernetes charm for an Express app
======================================================

Imagine you have an Express app backed up by a database
such as PostgreSQL and need to deploy it. In a traditional setup,
this can be quite a challenge, but with Charmcraft you'll find
yourself packaging and deploying your Express app in no time.
In this tutorial we will build a Kubernetes charm for an Express
app using Charmcraft, so we can have an Express app
up and running with Juju. Let's get started!

This tutorial should take 90 minutes for you to complete.

If you're new to the charming world, Express apps are
specifically supported with a template to quickly generate a
**rock** and a matching template to generate a **charm**.
A rock is a special kind of OCI-compliant container image, while a
charm is a software operator for cloud operations that use the Juju
orchestration engine. The result is an Express app that
can be easily deployed, configured, scaled, and integrated
on any Kubernetes cluster.


What you'll need
----------------

- A local system, e.g., a laptop, with AMD64 or ARM64 architecture which
  has sufficient resources to launch a virtual machine with 4 CPUs,
  4 GB RAM, and a 50 GB disk.
- Familiarity with Linux.


What you'll do
--------------

#. Create an Express app.
#. Use that to create a rock with Rockcraft.
#. Use that to create a charm with Charmcraft.
#. Use that to test, deploy, configure, etc., your Express app on a local
   Kubernetes cloud with Juju.
#. Repeat the process, mimicking a real development process.

    Should you get stuck or notice issues, please get in touch on
    `Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#12-factor-charms:ubuntu.com>`_ or
    `Discourse <https://discourse.charmhub.io/>`_


Set things up
-------------

.. include:: /reuse/tutorial/setup_edge.rst
.. |12FactorApp| replace:: Express

Create a directory for the app:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-working-dir]
    :end-before: [docs:create-working-dir-end]
    :dedent: 2

As the ``expressjs-framework`` extensions for Rockcraft and Charmcraft are
still in development, we must enable experimental extensions for each:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:export-experimental-env-vars]
    :end-before: [docs:export-experimental-env-vars-end]
    :dedent: 2

Create the Express app
----------------------

Start by creating the "Hello, world" Express app that will be
used for this tutorial.

Install ``npm`` and ``express-generator`` to initialize the Express module:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:install-init-expressjs]
    :end-before: [docs:install-init-expressjs-end]
    :dedent: 2


Run the Express app locally
---------------------------

Install the necessary packages for the app so it can run:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:build-expressjs]
    :end-before: [docs:build-expressjs-end]
    :dedent: 2

With the packages installed, let's run the Express app to verify
that it works:

.. code-block:: bash

   npm start

Test the Express app by using ``curl`` to send a request to the root
endpoint. You will need a new terminal for this; use
``multipass shell charm-dev`` to open a new terminal in Multipass:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:curl-expressjs]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-expressjs-end]
    :dedent: 2

If the output has an *HTTP/1.1 200 OK* status message, then we know the newly-built
app is working.

The Express app looks good, so we can stop it for now from the
original terminal using :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`C`.


Pack the Express app into a rock
--------------------------------

Now let's create a container image for our Express app. We'll use a rock,
which is an OCI-compliant container image based on Ubuntu.

First, we'll need a ``rockcraft.yaml`` project file. We'll take advantage of a
pre-defined extension in Rockcraft with the ``--profile`` flag that caters
initial rock files for specific web app frameworks. Using the
``expressjs-framework`` profile, Rockcraft automates the creation of
``rockcraft.yaml`` and tailors the file for an Express app.
From the ``~/expressjs-hello-world`` directory, initialize the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-rockcraft-yaml]
    :end-before: [docs:create-rockcraft-yaml-end]
    :dedent: 2

The ``rockcraft.yaml`` file will automatically be created and set the name
based on your working directory.

Check out the contents of ``rockcraft.yaml``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cat rockcraft.yaml

The top of the file should look similar to the following snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml

    name: expressjs-hello-world
    # see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/explanation/bases/
    # for more information about bases and using 'bare' bases for chiselled rocks
    base: bare # as an alternative, a ubuntu base can be used
    build-base: ubuntu@24.04 # build-base is required when the base is bare
    version: '0.1' # just for humans. Semantic versioning is recommended
    summary: A summary of your ExpressJS app # 79 char long summary
    description: |
        This is expressjs-hello-world's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
        most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
        we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
        container registries out there.
    # the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
        amd64:
        # arm64:
        # ppc64el:
        # s390x:

    ...

Verfiy that the ``name`` is ``expressjs-hello-world``.

Ensure that ``platforms`` includes the architecture of your host. Check
the architecture of your system:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --print-architecture


Edit the ``platforms`` key in ``rockcraft.yaml`` if required.

Let's pack the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:pack]
    :end-before: [docs:pack-end]
    :dedent: 2

Depending on your system and network, this step can take several
minutes to finish.

.. admonition:: For more options when packing rocks

    See the :external+rockcraft:ref:`ref_commands_pack` command reference.

Once Rockcraft has finished packing the Express rock,
the terminal will respond with something similar to
``Packed expressjs-hello-world_0.1_<architecture>.rock``.
The file name reflects your system's architecture. After
the initial pack, subsequent rock packings are faster.

The rock needs to be copied to the MicroK8s registry, which stores OCI
archives so they can be downloaded and deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.
Copy the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:skopeo-copy]
    :end-before: [docs:skopeo-copy-end]
    :dedent: 2

This command contains the following pieces:

- ``--insecure-policy``: adopts a permissive policy that
  removes the need for a dedicated policy file.
- ``--dest-tls-verify=false``: disables the need for HTTPS
  and verify certificates while interacting with the MicroK8s registry.
- ``oci-archive``: specifies the rock we created for our Express app.
- ``docker``: specifies the name of the image in the MicroK8s registry.

.. seealso::

    `Ubuntu manpage | skopeo
    <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/skopeo.1.html>`_


Create the charm
----------------

From the ``~/expressjs-hello-world`` directory, let's create a new directory
for the charm and change inside it:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-charm-dir]
    :end-before: [docs:create-charm-dir-end]
    :dedent: 2

Similar to the rock, we'll take advantage of a pre-defined extension in
Charmcraft with the ``--profile`` flag that caters initial charm files for
specific web app frameworks. Using the ``expressjs-framework`` profile, Charmcraft
automates the creation of the files needed for our charm, including a
``charmcraft.yaml`` project file, ``requirements.txt`` and source code for the
charm. The source code contains the logic required to operate the Express app.

Initialize a charm named ``expressjs-hello-world``:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:charm-init]
    :end-before: [docs:charm-init-end]
    :dedent: 2

The files will automatically be created in your working directory.

Check out the contents of ``charmcraft.yaml``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cat charmcraft.yaml

The top of the file should look similar to the following snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/charm/charmcraft.yaml

    # This file configures Charmcraft.
    # See https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charmcraft-config for guidance.

    name: expressjs-hello-world

    type: charm

    base: ubuntu@24.04

    # the platforms this charm should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
      amd64:
      # arm64:
      # ppc64el:
      # s390x:

    # (Required)
    summary: A very short one-line summary of the ExpressJS app.

    ...

Verify that the ``name`` is ``expressjs-hello-world``. Ensure that ``platforms``
includes the architecture of your host. Edit the ``platforms`` key in the
project file if required.

Let's pack the charm:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:charm-pack]
    :end-before: [docs:charm-pack-end]
    :dedent: 2

Depending on your system and network, this step can take several
minutes to finish.

Once Charmcraft has finished packing the charm, the terminal will
respond with something similar to
``Packed expressjs-hello-world_ubuntu-24.04-<architecture>.charm``.
The file name reflects your system's architecture. After the initial
pack, subsequent charm packings are faster.

.. admonition:: For more options when packing charms

    See the :literalref:`pack<ref_commands_pack>` command reference.


Deploy the Express app
------------------------

A Juju model is needed to handle Kubernetes resources while deploying
the Express app. The Juju model holds the app along with any supporting
components. In this tutorial, our model will hold the Express app, ingress,
and a PostgreSQL database.

Let's create a new model:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:add-juju-model]
    :end-before: [docs:add-juju-model-end]
    :dedent: 2

Constrain the Juju model to your architecture:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:add-model-constraints]
    :end-before: [docs:add-model-constraints-end]
    :dedent: 2

Now let's use the OCI image we previously uploaded to deploy the Express
app. Deploy using Juju by specifying the OCI image name with the
``--resource`` option:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:deploy-expressjs-app]
    :end-before: [docs:deploy-expressjs-app-end]
    :dedent: 2

It will take a few minutes to deploy the Express app. You can monitor its
progress with:

.. code-block:: bash

    juju status --watch 2s

It can take a couple of minutes for the app to finish the deployment.
Once the status of the App has gone to ``active``, you can stop watching
using :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`C`.

.. tip::

    To monitor your deployment, keep a ``juju status`` session active in a
    second terminal.

    See more: :external+juju:ref:`Juju | juju status <command-juju-status>`

The Express app should now be running. We can monitor the status of
the deployment using ``juju status``, which should be similar to the
following output:

.. terminal::
    :input: juju status

    Model                  Controller      Cloud/Region        Version  SLA          Timestamp
    expressjs-hello-world  dev-controller  microk8s/localhost  3.6.5    unsupported  12:24:51+03:00

    App                    Version  Status  Scale  Charm                  Channel  Rev  Address        Exposed  Message
    expressjs-hello-world           active      1  expressjs-hello-world             0  10.152.183.38  no

    Unit                      Workload  Agent  Address      Ports  Message
    expressjs-hello-world/0*  active    idle   10.1.157.75

Let's expose the app using ingress. Deploy the
``nginx-ingress-integrator`` charm and integrate it with the Express app:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:deploy-nginx]
    :end-before: [docs:deploy-nginx-end]
    :dedent: 2

The hostname of the app needs to be defined so that it is accessible via
the ingress. We will also set the default route to be the root endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:config-nginx]
    :end-before: [docs:config-nginx-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. note::

    By default, the port for the ``express-framework`` extension should be 8080.
    If you want to change the default port, it can be done with the configuration
    option ``port`` that will be exposed as the ``PORT`` to the Express app.

Monitor ``juju status`` until everything has a status of ``active``.

Use
``curl -I http://expressjs-hello-world  --resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1``
to send a request via the ingress. It should show the
``HTTP/1.1 200 OK`` status message.

.. note::

    The ``--resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1`` option to the ``curl``
    command is a way of resolving the hostname of the request without
    setting a DNS record.

The development cycle
---------------------

So far, we have worked though the entire cycle, from creating an app to deploying it.
But now – as in every real-world case – we will go through the experience of iterating
to develop the app, and deploy each iteration.

Configure the Express app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To demonstrate how to provide a configuration to the Express app,
we will make the greeting configurable. We will expect this
configuration option to be available in the Express app configuration under the
keyword ``GREETING``. Change to the ``~/expressjs-hello-world/app/routes``
directory and replace the code in ``index.js`` with
the following:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/greeting_index.js
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/app/routes/index.js
    :emphasize-lines: 3-7
    :language: javascript

Update the rock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we’re changing the app we should update the version of the rock.
Increment the ``version`` in ``rockcraft.yaml`` to ``0.2`` such that the
top of the ``rockcraft.yaml`` file looks similar to the following:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    name: expressjs-hello-world
    # see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/explanation/bases/
    # for more information about bases and using 'bare' bases for chiselled rocks
    base: bare # as an alternative, a ubuntu base can be used
    build-base: ubuntu@24.04 # build-base is required when the base is bare
    version: '0.2' # just for humans. Semantic versioning is recommended
    summary: A summary of your ExpressJS app # 79 char long summary
    description: |
        This is expressjs-hello-world's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
        most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
        we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
        container registries out there.
    # the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
        amd64:
        # arm64:
        # ppc64el:
        # s390x:

    ...

Let's pack and upload the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:docker-update]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-update-end]
    :dedent: 2

Redeploy the charm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ll redeploy the new version with ``juju refresh``.

Change back into the charm directory using ``cd charm``.

The ``expressjs-framework`` Charmcraft extension supports adding configurations
to ``charmcraft.yaml``, which will be passed as environment variables to
the Express app. Add the following to the end of the
``charmcraft.yaml`` file:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/greeting_charmcraft.yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/charm/charmcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml

.. note::

    Configuration options are automatically capitalized and ``-`` are replaced
    by ``_``. An ``APP_`` prefix will also be added as a namespace
    for app configurations.

We can now pack and deploy the new version of the Express app:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:refresh-deployment]
    :end-before: [docs:refresh-deployment-end]
    :dedent: 2

After we wait for a bit monitoring ``juju status`` the app
should go back to ``active`` again. Verify that the new configuration
has been added using
``juju config expressjs-hello-world | grep -A 6 greeting:``,
which should show the configuration option.

Using ``curl http://expressjs-hello-world  --resolve
expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1``
shows that the response is ``Hello, world!`` as expected.

Now let's change the greeting:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:change-config]
    :end-before: [docs:change-config-end]
    :dedent: 2

After we wait for a moment for the app to be restarted, using
``curl http://expressjs-hello-world  --resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1``
should now return the updated ``Hi!`` greeting.


Integrate with a database
-------------------------

Now let's keep track of how many visitors your app has received.
This will require integration with a database to keep the visitor count.
This will require a few changes:

- We will need to create a database migration that creates the ``visitors`` table.
- We will need to keep track how many times the root endpoint has been called
  in the database.
- We will need to add a new endpoint to retrieve the number of visitors from
  the database.

Let's start with the database migration to create the required tables.
The charm created by the ``expressjs-framework`` extension will execute the
``migrate.sh`` script if it exists. This script should ensure that the
database is initialized and ready to be used by the app. We will
create a ``migrate.sh`` file containing this logic.

Back out to the ``~/expressjs-hello-world/app`` directory.
Create the ``migrate.sh`` file using a text editor and paste the
following code into it:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/visitors_migrate.sh
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/app/migrate.sh
    :language: bash

.. note::

    The charm will pass the Database connection string in the
    ``POSTGRESQL_DB_CONNECT_STRING`` environment variable once
    PostgreSQL has been integrated with the charm.

Change the permissions of the file ``migrate.sh`` so that it is executable:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:change-migrate-permissions]
    :end-before: [docs:change-migrate-permissions-end]
    :dedent: 2

To connect the Express app to PostgreSQL, we will use
the ``pg-promise`` library. The app code needs to be updated to keep track of
the number of visitors and to include a new endpoint to retrieve the
number of visitors. Create a new file called
``visitors.js`` in the ``~/expressjs-hello-world/app/routes`` directory
and paste the following code into it:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/visitors.js
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/app/routes/visitors.js
    :language: javascript

Open ``index.js`` in a text editor and
replace the code in it with the following to record the number of
visitors:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/visitors_index.js
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/app/routes/index.js
    :language: javascript

Change back to the ``~/expressjs-hello-world/app`` directory,
open ``app.js`` in a text editor and replace its content with the following
code to add the new route:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/visitors_app.js
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/app/app.js
    :language: javascript

Add the new package in the Express project:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:check-expressjs-app]
    :end-before: [docs:check-expressjs-app-end]
    :dedent: 2

Update the rock again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the migrations to work, we need the ``postgresql-client`` package
installed in the rock. By default, the ``expressjs-framework`` uses the ``bare``
base, so we will also need to install a shell interpreter. Let's do it as a
slice, so that the rock doesn't include unnecessary files. Open the
``rockcraft.yaml`` file using a text editor and add the following to the
end of the file:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/visitors_rockcraft.yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml

Increment the ``version`` in ``rockcraft.yaml`` to ``0.3`` such that the
top of the ``rockcraft.yaml`` file looks similar to the following:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    name: expressjs-hello-world
    # see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/explanation/bases/
    # for more information about bases and using 'bare' bases for chiselled rocks
    base: bare # as an alternative, a ubuntu base can be used
    build-base: ubuntu@24.04 # build-base is required when the base is bare
    version: '0.3' # just for humans. Semantic versioning is recommended
    summary: A summary of your ExpressJS app # 79 char long summary
    description: |
        This is expressjs-hello-world's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
        most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
        we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
        container registries out there.
    # the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
        amd64:
        # arm64:
        # ppc64el:
        # s390x:

    ...

Let's pack and upload the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:docker-2nd-update]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-2nd-update-end]
    :dedent: 2

Update the charm again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change back into the charm directory using ``cd charm``.

The Express app now requires a database which needs to be declared in the
``charmcraft.yaml`` file. Open ``charmcraft.yaml`` in a text editor and
add the following section to the end of the file:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/visitors_charmcraft.yaml
    :caption: ~/expressjs-hello-world/charm/charmcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml

We can now pack and deploy the new version of the Express app:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:refresh-2nd-deployment]
    :end-before: [docs:refresh-2nd-deployment-end]
    :dedent: 2

Now let's deploy PostgreSQL and integrate it with the Express app:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:deploy-postgres]
    :end-before: [docs:deploy-postgres-end]
    :dedent: 2

Wait for ``juju status`` to show that the App is ``active`` again.
During this time, the Express app may enter a ``blocked`` state as it
waits to become integrated with the PostgreSQL database. Due to the
``optional: false`` key in the endpoint definition, the Express app will not
start until the database is ready.

Once the Express app is ``active``, running ``curl http://expressjs-hello-world
--resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1``
should still return the ``Hi!`` greeting.

To check the local visitors, use
``curl http://expressjs-hello-world/visitors  --resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1``,
which should return ``Number of visitors 1`` after the
previous request to the root endpoint.
This should be incremented each time the root endpoint is requested. If we
repeat this process, the output should be as follows:

.. terminal::
    :input: curl http://expressjs-hello-world  --resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1

    Hi!
    :input: curl http://expressjs-hello-world/visitors  --resolve expressjs-hello-world:80:127.0.0.1
    Number of visitors 2


Tear things down
----------------

We've reached the end of this tutorial. We went through the entire
development process, including:

- Creating a Express app
- Deploying the app locally
- Packaging the app using Rockcraft
- Building the app with Ops code using Charmcraft
- Deplyoing the app using Juju
- Exposing the app using an ingress
- Configuring the app
- Integrating the app with a database

If you'd like to quickly tear things down, start by exiting the Multipass VM:

.. code-block:: bash

    exit

And then you can proceed with its deletion:

.. code-block:: bash

    multipass delete charm-dev
    multipass purge

If you'd like to manually reset your working environment, you can run the
following in the rock directory ``~/expressjs-hello-world`` for the tutorial:

.. literalinclude:: code/expressjs/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:clean-environment]
    :end-before: [docs:clean-environment-end]
    :dedent: 2

You can also clean up your Multipass instance by exiting and deleting it
using the same commands as above.
