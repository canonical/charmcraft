``LICENSE`` file
================

The ``LICENSE`` file is the file where you specify the license you want to use for your
charm.

Charmcraft pre-populates the LICENSE file with the `Apache 2
<https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`_ license. Before publication, it is
important that you consider the implications of this and select a license appropriate
for your use case. If you're not sure which license to select, `choosealicense.com
<https://choosealicense.com>`_ can help you. For most charms, we recommend `Apache 2
<https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`_, as this will allow for simple
modification, redistribution, and packaging by the Charmhub community.
