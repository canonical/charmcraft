The `requirements-dev.txt` is a standard Python [requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format) that specifies only those dependencies that are used during development. Examples of this might include testing libraries, linters, etc. These dependencies will not be bundled with the charm when it is built.
