class Timer:
    """Get the timing of a block of code.

    It can work as a context manager that generates a measurement of the block of code inside
    its context, or as a decorator to get the timing of the whole decorated function.

    Usage as a context manager:

        with timer("some message", more="stuff", answer=42):
            ...

    Usage as a decorator:

        @timer("some message", foo="bar")
        def foo(...):
            ...

    In both cases the message is mandatory and the extra info optional.

    Also this class provides a `mark` method to sub-divide the context manager code
    block. How to use it:

        with timer("some message") as cm:
            ...
            cm.mark("first half done!")
