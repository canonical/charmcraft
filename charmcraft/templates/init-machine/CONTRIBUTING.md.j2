# Contributing

To make contributions to this charm, you'll need a working
[development setup](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-your-deployment/#set-up-your-deployment-local-testing-and-development).

You can create an environment for development with `tox`:

```shell
tox devenv -e integration
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Testing

This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some pre-configured environments
that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

```shell
tox run -e format        # update your code according to linting rules
tox run -e lint          # code style
tox run -e static        # static type checking
tox run -e unit          # unit tests
tox run -e integration   # integration tests
tox                      # runs 'format', 'lint', 'static', and 'unit' environments
```

## Build the charm

Build the charm in this git repository using:
