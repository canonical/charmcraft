How it works
------------

During the build step, the plugin performs the following actions:

1. It creates a virtual environment in the
   :ref:`${CRAFT_PART_INSTALL}/venv <craft_parts_step_execution_environment>` directory.
2. It uses :command:`poetry export` to create a ``requirements.txt`` in the project's
   build directory.
3. It uses :command:`pip` to install the packages referenced in ``requirements.txt``
   into the virtual environment. Undeclared dependencies are ignored.
4. It copies any existing ``src`` and ``lib`` directories from your charm project into
   the final charm.
5. It runs :command:`pip check` to ensure the virtual environment is consistent.

Example
-------

The following ``charmcraft.yaml`` file can be used with a poetry project to build
the charm for Ubuntu 24.04:

.. literalinclude:: poetry-charmcraft.yaml
   :language: yaml
