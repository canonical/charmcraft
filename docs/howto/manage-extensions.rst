View details about the extension in use
---------------------------------------

Suppose you've initialised a rock / charm with a profile that comes with
an extension (currently, ``flask-framework``), and your
``rockcraft.yaml`` / ``charmcraft.yaml > extensions`` lists this
extension.

.. collapse:: Example

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir my-flask-app-k8s
      cd my-flask-app-k8s/
      charmcraft init --profile flask-framework

  .. terminal::

      Charmed operator package file and directory tree initialised.

      Now edit the following package files to provide fundamental charm metadata
      and other information:

      charmcraft.yaml
      src/charm.py
      README.md

  .. code-block:: bash

      ls -R

  .. terminal::

      .:
      charmcraft.yaml  requirements.txt  src

      ./src:
      charm.py

  .. code-block:: bash

      cat charmcraft.yaml

  .. code-block:: yaml

      name: my-flask-app-k8s

      type: charm

      bases:
        - build-on:
          - name: ubuntu
            channel: "22.04"
          run-on:
          - name: ubuntu
            channel: "22.04"

      extensions:

      # Uncomment the integrations used by your application
      # requires:

To view details about what that extension is adding to your charm, set the
``CHARMCRAFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXTENSIONS`` environment variable to ``1``,
then run  ``charmcraft expand-extensions``. For example:

.. collapse:: Expanding an extension

   .. code-block:: bash

      CHARMCRAFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXTENSIONS=1 charmcraft expand-extensions

  .. terminal::

      *EXPERIMENTAL* extension 'flask-framework' enabled
