Charmcraft 3.5 release notes
============================

26 May 2025

Learn about the new features, changes, and fixes introduced in Charmcraft 3.5.


Requirements and compatibility
------------------------------

For development and testing, Charmcraft requires a host with a minimum of 4GB RAM
running a Linux distribution compatible with systemd.

All versions of Charmcraft require the following software:

- systemd
- `snapd`_
- Either `LXD`_ or `Multipass`_

We recommend you install the `Charmcraft snap <https://snapcraft.io/charmcraft>`_. It
comes comes bundled with all its dependencies.

Non-snap installations of Charmcraft have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- libgit2 1.7
- `skopeo`_
- `Spread`_


What's new
----------

Charmcraft 3.5 brings the following features, integrations, and improvements.


Updated ``init`` templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The templates generated by ``charmcraft init`` now use the new
:doc:`/reference/platforms` format.


Editor Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `JSON Schema Store <https://schemastore.org>`_ now includes a schema for the
:ref:`charmcraft-yaml-file`.

If your IDE supports fetching JSON schemas from the store, you can now load the latest.
