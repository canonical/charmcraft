Show charmcraft version.

The output has the following format: X.Y.Z[+N.gHASH[.dirty]]

Where:

- X, Y and Z are the major, minor and patch version numbers,
  upgraded when a release is done

- +N.gHASH is present if using charmcraft from the project (how many
  commits after last release, and last commit's hash)

- .dirty is present if the branch you're executing charmcraft from has
  modifications

Example: 0.3.1+40.g883455b.dirty
