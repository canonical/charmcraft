Charmcraft is a command-line tool designed to simplify the building, packaging,
and publishing of :external+juju:ref:`Juju charms <charm>`.

Charmcraft empowers charm authors to simplify their workflow by automating the
creation of project files with application-specific extensions. Charm authors
can then use Charmcraft to build distribution-ready charms before sharing them
on `Charmhub`_, where they can use channels and tracks to easily manage
releases.

While there are many ways to develop charms, Charmcraft and the
:external+ops:doc:`ops <index>` Python library provide a truly end-to-end charm
development experience.

Whether you're just getting started with charms or managing a vast array of
cloud applications for your business, Charmcraft will prove to be an invaluable
tool.
