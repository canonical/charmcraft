Tutorial
========

Our tutorial comes in multiple flavours -- pick your flavour of choice!

.. note::

    Currently all our tutorial flavours demonstrate Charmcraft in combination with
    an 12-factor app extension -- a journey that doesn't require any `ops <Operator
    framework>`_ and which don't currently include publishing the charm. To get a
    sense of the workflow for other types of apps and including the publication step,
    see :ref:`manage-charms`.
