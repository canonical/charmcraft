Manage charms
=============

    See first: :external+juju:ref:`Juju | Charm <charm>`,
    :external+juju:ref:`Juju | Manage charms <manage-charms>`


Initialise a charm
------------------

To initialise a charm project, create a directory for your charm, enter it, then run
``charmcraft init`` with the ``--profile`` flag followed by a suitable profile name (for
machine charms: ``machine``; for Kubernetes charms: ``kubernetes``, ``simple``, or
``flask-framework``); that will create all the necessary files and even prepopulate them
with useful content.

.. code-block:: bash

    charmcraft init --profile <profile>

.. collapse:: Example session

    .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir my-flask-app-k8s
        cd my-flask-app-k8s/
        charmcraft init --profile flask-framework

    .. terminal::

        Charmed operator package file and directory tree initialised
        Now edit the following package files to provide fundamental charm metadata
        and other information:

        charmcraft.yaml
        src/charm.py
        README.md

    .. code-block:: bash

        ls -R

    .. terminal::

        .:
        charmcraft.yaml  requirements.txt  src

        ./src:
        charm.py

The command also allows you to not specify any profile (in that case you get the
``simple`` profile -- a Kubernetes profile with lots of scaffolding, suitable for
beginners) and has flags that you can use to specify a different directory to operate
in, a charm name different from the name of the root directory, etc.

Add docs and a link to the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you publish your charm on Charmhub, reference documentation about the charm's
resources, actions, configurations, relations, and libraries is extracted automatically.
However, you should also aim to add further docs, e.g., a tutorial, how-to guides, etc.
To provide a link to these docs, in your charm's ``charmcraft.yaml`` file specify a
value for the :ref:`links.documentation <recipe-key-documentation>` key. Note

    See more: :ref:`manage-parts`


Pack a charm
------------

To pack a charm directory, in the charm's root directory, run the command below:

.. code-block:: bash

    charmcraft pack

This will fetch any dependencies (from PyPI, based on ``requirements.txt``),
compile any modules, check that all the key files are in place, and produce a
compressed archive with the extension ``.charm``. As you can verify, this archive
is just a zip file with metadata and the operator code itself.

.. collapse:: Example session for a charm called microsample-vm

    Pack the charm:

    .. code-block:: bash

        charmcraft pack

    .. terminal::

        Created 'microsample-vm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm'.
        Charms packed:
          microsample-vm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm

    Optionally, verify that this has created a .charm file in your charm's root directory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ls

    .. terminal::

        CONTRIBUTING.md  charmcraft.yaml                          requirements.txt  tox.ini
        LICENSE          microsample-vm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm  src
        README.md        pyproject.toml                           tests

    Optionally, verify that the .charm file is simply a zip file that contains
    everything you've packed plus any dependencies:

    .. code-block:: bash

        unzip -l microsample-vm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm | { head; tail;}

    .. terminal::

        Archive:  microsample-vm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm

The command has a number of flags that allow you to specify a different charm directory
to pack, whether to force pack if there are linting errors, etc.

   See more: :ref:`ref_commands_pack`

.. caution::

    **If you've declared any resources :** This will *not* pack the resources.
    This means that, when you upload your charm to Charmhub (if you do), you will
    have to upload the resources separately. See more: :ref:`manage-resources`.

.. important::

    When the charm is packed, a series of analyses and lintings will happen,
    you may receive warnings and even errors to help improve the quality of the
    charm. See more:
    :ref:`Charmcraft analyzers and linters <charmcraft-analyzers-and-linters>`

..

    See next: :external+juju:ref:`Juju | Manage charms <manage-charms>`

.. _publish-a-charm:

Publish a charm on Charmhub
---------------------------

1. Log in to Charmhub:

   .. code-block:: bash

       charmcraft login

    ..

   See more: :ref:`manage-the-current-charmhub-user`

2. Register your charm's name (the one you specified in ``charmcraft.yaml`` > ``name``):

   .. code-block:: bash

       charmcraft register my-awesome-charm

   ..

   See more: :ref:`manage-names`

   .. note::

       This automatically creates 4 channels, all with track ``latest`` but with
       different risk levels, namely, edge, beta, candidate, stable, respectively.

   See more: :ref:`manage-channels`.

3. Upload the charm to Charmhub: Use the ``charmcraft upload`` command followed by the
   your charm's filepath. E.g., if you are in the charm's root directory,

   .. code-block:: bash

       charmcraft upload my-awesome-charm.charm

   .. terminal::

       Revision 1 of my-awesome-charm created

   ..

   See more: :ref:`ref_commands_upload`

   .. note::

       Each time you upload a charm to Charmhub, that creates a revision (unless
       you upload the exact same file again). See more: :ref:`manage-charm-revisions`.

4. If your charm has associated resources: These are not packed with the rest of the
   charm project, so you must upload them explicitly to Charmhub as well. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

       charmcraft upload-resource my-super-charm someresource
       --filepath=/tmp/superdb.bin

   .. terminal::

       Revision 1 created of resource 'someresource' for charm 'my-super-charm'

   ..

   See more: :ref:`manage-resources`

   .. note::

       Each time you upload a resource to Charmhub, that creates a revision (unless you
       upload the exact same file again). See more: :ref:`manage-resource-revisions`.

5. Release the charm: To release a charm, release your revision of
   choice to the target release channel. E.g.,

   .. code-block:: bash

       charmcraft release my-awesome-charm --revision=1 --channel=beta

   .. terminal::

       Revision 1 of charm 'my-awesome-charm' released to beta

    ..

   See more: :ref:`manage-charm-revisions`

   .. note::

       This automatically opens the channel. See more: :ref:`manage-channels`.

   ..

   See next: :external+juju:ref:`Juju | Deploy a charm <deploy-a-charm>`,
   :external+juju:ref:`Juju | Update a charm <update-a-charm>`

.. tip::

    To update the charm on Charmhub, repeat the upload and release steps.

.. important::

    Releasing a charm on Charmhub gives it a public URL. However, the charm will not
    appear in the Charmhub search results until it has passed formal review. To request
    formal review, reach out to the community to announce your charm and ask for a
    review by an experienced community member. See more: `Discourse | review requests
    <https://discourse.charmhub.io/c/charmhub-requests/46>`_.

    Also, the point of publishing and having a charm publicly listed on Charmhub is so
    others can reuse it and potentially contribute to it as well. To publicise your
    charm:

    - `Write a Discourse post to announce your release.
      <https://discourse.charmhub.io/tags/c/announcements-and-community/33/none>`_

    - `Schedule a community workshop to demo your charm's capabilities.
      <https://discourse.charmhub.io/tag/community-workshop>`_

    - `Chat about it with your charmer friends.
      <https://matrix.to/#/#charmhub-charmdev:ubuntu.com>`_
