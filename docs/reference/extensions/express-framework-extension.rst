Express framework extension
=============================

The ``expressjs-framework`` extension includes configuration options customised
for an Express application. This document describes all the keys that a user
may interact with.

.. tip::

    If you'd like to see the full contents contributed by this extension,
    see :ref:`How to manage extensions <manage-extensions>`.


``charmcraft.yaml`` > ``config`` > ``options``
----------------------------------------------

You can use the predefined options (run ``charmcraft expand-extensions`` for details)
but also add your own, as needed.

The predefined configuration options for the ``expressjs-framework`` are:

* **app-port**: Port in which the application should listen. The ingress will be
  configured using this port. The environment variable passed to the app is
  ``APP_PORT``. Default value is 8080.

* **app-secret-key-id**: A secret you can use for sessions, protection against
  cross-site request forgery, or any other thing where you need a random secret shared
  by all units. The environment variable passed to the app is ``APP_SECRET_KEY``.
  The secret should contain a single key, ``value``, which maps to the actual
  application secret key. To create the secret, run the following command:
  ``juju add-secret my-app-secret-key value=<secret-string>``, grant the application
  access to the secret and use the output secret ID to configure
  this option. If this configuration option is not set, the environment variable
  ``APP_SECRET_KEY`` is a 64 byte Base64 encoded random string.

* **metrics-port**: Port where the Prometheus metrics will be scraped. The environment
  variable passed to the app is ``METRICS_PORT``. Default value is 8080.

* **metrics-path**: Path where the Prometheus metrics will be scraped. The environment
  variable passed to the app is ``METRICS_PATH``. Default value is ``/metrics``.

In case you want to add extra configuration options, any option you define will be used
to generate environment variables; a user-defined option ``config-option-name`` will
generate an environment variable named ``APP_CONFIG_OPTION_NAME`` where the option name
is converted to upper case, dashes are converted to underscores and ``APP_`` is added at
the front.

In either case, you will be able to set it in the usual way by running ``juju config
<application> <option>=<value>``. For example, if you define an option called ``token``,
as below, this will generate a ``APP_TOKEN`` environment variable, and a user of your
charm can set it by running ``juju config <application> token=<token>``.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: charmcraft.yaml

    config:
      options:
        token:
          description: The token for the service.
          type: string

HTTP Proxy
----------

Proxy settings should be set as model configurations. Charms generated using the
``expressjs-framework`` extension will make the Juju proxy settings available as the
``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY`` and ``NO_PROXY`` environment variables. For example, the
``juju-http-proxy`` environment variable will be exposed as ``HTTP_PROXY`` to the
Express service.

    See more: `List of model configuration
    keys <https://juju.is/docs/juju/list-of-model-configuration-keys>`_


Background Tasks
----------------

Extra services defined in the file
:external+rockcraft:ref:`rockcraft.yaml <rockcraft.yaml_reference>`
with names ending in ``-worker`` or ``-scheduler`` will be passed the same environment
variables as the main application. If there is more than one unit in the application,
the services with the name ending in ``-worker`` will run in all units. The services
with name ending in ``-scheduler`` will only run in one of the units of the application.


Observability
-------------

12-Factor charms are designed to be easily observable using the
`Canonical Observability Stack
<https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack>`__.

You can easily integrate your charm with
`Loki <https://charmhub.io/loki-k8s>`__,
`Prometheus <https://charmhub.io/prometheus-k8s>`__ and
`Grafana <https://charmhub.io/grafana-k8s>`__ using Juju.

.. code-block:: bash

    juju integrate expressjs-k8s grafana
    juju integrate expressjs-k8s loki
    juju integrate expressjs-k8s prometheus

After integration, you will be able to observe your workload
using Grafana dashboards.

In addition to that you can also trace your workload code
using `Tempo <https://charmhub.io/topics/charmed-tempo-ha>`__.

To learn about how to deploy Tempo you can read the
documentation `here <https://charmhub.io/topics/charmed-tempo-ha>`__.

OpenTelemetry will automatically read the environment variables
and configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to use them.
See the `OpenTelemetry documentation
<https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
for further information about tracing.


Secrets
-------

Juju secrets can be passed as environment variables to your Express application. The
secret ID has to be passed to the application as a config option in the project file of
type ``secret``. This config option has to be populated with the secret ID, in the
format ``secret:<secret ID>``.

The environment variable name passed to the application will be:

.. code-block:: bash

    APP_<config option name>_<key inside the secret>

The ``<config option name>`` and ``<key inside the secret>`` keywords in the environment
variable name will have the hyphens replaced by underscores and all the letters
capitalised.
