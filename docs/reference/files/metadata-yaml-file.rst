``metadata.yaml`` file
======================

This document describes the ``metadata.yaml`` file in your charm project.

.. caution::

    Starting with Charmcraft 2.5, the ``metadata.yaml`` file is created
    automatically from information you provide in the :ref:`charmcraft-yaml-file`. For
    backwards compatibility, Charmcraft will continue to allow the use of the
    ``metadata.yaml`` file, but you may not duplicate keys across the two files.

.. important::

    The project file follows keywords similar to snaps, but
    ``metadata.yaml`` does not. As a result, when ``charmcraft pack`` generates
    the file, some keys may differ -- e.g., the project's ``title``  key from
    is rendered as ``display-name`` in ``metadata.yaml``.

This file contains identifying and configuration information about the charm.
Identifying information is used to describe the charm, its author, and its purpose; it
is indexed by `Charmhub`_ to enable easy discovery of charms. Configuration information
is provided by the charm author to inform `Juju`_ how and where to deploy the charm
depending on the intended platform, storage requirements, resources, and possible
integrations.

The file is a YAML dictionary and consists of a number of keys and their values. There
are 3 keys that are required for all charms: `name`_, `summary`_ , and `description`_.
Then, also keys that are required only for Kubernetes charms, e.g., `containers`_.
Additionally, 15+ optional keys. Finally, any number of arbitrary keys; these can serve
to keep track of other choices a charmer might make.

``assumes``
-----------

.. Based on https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/assumes/5450#feature-names-and-version-constraints

**Status:** Optional. Recommended for Kubernetes charms.

**Purpose:** The ``assumes`` key  allows charm authors to explicitly state in the
metadata of a charm various features that a Juju model must be able to provide to ensure
that the charm can be successfully deployed on it. When a charm comes preloaded with
such requirements, this enables Juju to perform a pre-deployment check and to display
user-friendly error messages if a feature requirement cannot be met by the model that
the user is trying to deploy the charm to. If the assumes section of the charm metadata
is omitted, Juju will make a best-effort attempt to deploy the charm, and users must
rely on the output of ``juju status`` to figure out whether the deployment was
successful. The ``assumes`` key is available since 2.9.23.

**Structure:** The key consists of a list of features that can be given either directly
or, depending on the complexity of the condition you want to enforce, nested under one
or both of the boolean expressions ``any-of`` or ``all-of``, as shown below. In order
for a charm to be deployed, all entries in the ``assumes`` block must be satisfied.

.. code-block:: yaml

    assumes:
      - <feature_name>
      - any-of:
        - <feature_name>
        - <feature_name>
      - all-of:
        - <feature_name>
        - <feature_name>

The supported feature names are as below:

.. list-table::

    * - ``juju <comparison predicate> <version number>`` E.g., ``juju < 3.0``
      - The charm deploys if and only if the model runs agent binaries with the
        specified Juju version(s).
      - Since 2.9.23
    * - ``k8s-api``
      - The charm deploys if and only if the underlying substrate for the model
        is Kubernetes.
      - Since 2.9.23

The Boolean expressions are defined as below:

.. list-table::

    * - ``any-of``
      - The sub-expression is satisfied if any of the provided child expressions is
        satisfied.
    * - ``all-of``
      - The sub-expression is satisfied if all of the provided
        child expressions are satisfied.

Examples:

.. dropdown:: Simple example

    .. code-block:: yaml

        assumes:
          - juju >= 2.9.23
          - k8s-api

.. dropdown:: Example with a nested expression

    .. code-block:: yaml

        assumes:
          - any_of:
            - juju >= 2.9
            - k8s-api


``charm-user``
--------------

.. important::

    ``charm-user`` was added in Juju 3.6.0. It's currently only supported by
    Kubernetes charms and has no effect on machine charms.

**Status:** Optional. Recommended for Kubernetes charms.

**Purpose:** The ``charm-user`` key  allows charm authors to specify that their charm
hook code does not need to be run as root. This key, in combination with ``uid`` and
``gid`` fields in ``containers``, allows the charm to be run rootless. If set to
``root``, the charm runs as root. If set to ``sudoer`` or ``non-root``, the charm runs
as a user other than root. If the value is ``sudoer``, the charm will be run as a user
with access to sudo to elevate its privileges.

**Structure:** The key consists of a single value. One of ``root``, ``sudoer`` or
``non-root``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # (Optional) What kind of user is required to run the charm code.
    # It can be one of root, sudoer or non-root.
    # Added in Juju 3.6.0. If not specified, root is assumed.
    charm-user: <one of root, sudoer or non-root>


``containers``
--------------

    See also: `resources <#resources>`_

**Status:** Required for Kubernetes charms (except for proxy charms running on
Kubernetes).

**Purpose:** The ``containers`` key allows you to define a map of containers to be
created adjacent to the charm (as a sidecar, in the same pod).

**Structure:** This key consists of a list of containers along with their specification.
Each container can be specified in terms of ``resource``, ``bases``, ``uid``, ``gid``
and ``mounts``, where one of either the ``resource`` or the ``bases`` subkeys must be
defined, and ``mounts`` is optional. ``resource`` stands for the OCI image resource used
to create the container; to use it, specify  an OCI image resource name (that you will
then define further in the `resources`_ block). ``bases`` is a list of bases to be used
for resolving a container image, in descending order of preference; to use it, specify a
base name (for example, ``ubuntu``, ``centos``, ``windows``, ``osx``, ``opensuse``), a
`channel <https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels>`_, and an architecture. ``mounts`` is a
list of mounted storages for this container; to use it, specify the name of the storage
to mount from the charm storage and, optionally, the location where to mount the
storage. And, starting with Juju 3.5.0, ``uid`` and ``gid`` are the UID and,
respectively, GID to run the Pebble entry process for this container as; they can be any
value from 0-999 or any value from 10,000 (values from 1000-9999 are reserved for users)
and the default is 0 (root).

Other keys
----------

In addition to the keys mentioned above, a ``metadata.yaml`` file may also contain other
arbitrary keys. These can serve to keep track of other choices a charmer might make. In
some cases these become semi-official, being adopted by many charmers and even
incorporated into CI processes. One such example is ``upstream-source``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # The upstream-source field is ignored by Juju. It is included here as a reference
    # so the integration testing suite knows which image to deploy during testing. This
    # field is also used by the 'canonical/charming-actions' Github action for automated
    # releasing.
    upstream-source: kennethreitz/httpbin
