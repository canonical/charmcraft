Manage tracks
=============

..    See also: :ref:`track` Add link to Juju docs > charm > channel > track

When you register a charm name on Charmhub, you automatically get 4 channels, all with
track ``latest``. However, as your charm evolves, you'll likely want to customise the
shape of this track (e.g., to align with the workload) and then create new tracks in the
new pattern. This document shows you how.

Request a track guardrail
-------------------------

..    See also: :ref:`guardrail` (link to new Juju docs > charm > channel > track > guardrail)

To request a track guardrail, contact a Charmhub admin by creating a post on Discourse
under the **charmhub requests** category, that is, here:
:literalref:`https://discourse.charmhub.io/c/charmhub-requests`.


.. _create-a-track:

Create a track
--------------

Once you've requested a track guardrail, there are two ways to create a new track for
your charm -- you can keep contacting a Charmhub admin every time or you can
self-service. For most cases the latter option is likely to be more convenient and
faster.


Ask a Charmhub admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new track by contacting a Charmhub admin, create a post on Discourse under
the `charmhub requests  category
<https://discourse.charmhub.io/c/charmhub-requests/46>`_. The admin will create the new
track that fits within the track guardrail you've set up for your charm.


Create it yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new track yourself, follow the steps below:

.. important::

    As you might notice, this path is currently a little hacky. In the long-term it
    should become a lot smoother as there are plans to support it through the Charmcraft
    CLI.

.. important::

    As you will see, this method currently relies on ``charmcraft`` + ``curl``. We
    recommend the Charmcraft bit because Charmcraft already understands the
    authentication mechanism used by Charmhub and can generate a suitable authentication
    token (macaroon) that will make it possible to then use ``curl`` directly to
    interact with the Charmhub API. This method also has the advantage that it can be
    adapted to use any HTTP client or library as long as it can pass custom headers.

1. Enable ``curl`` access to the Charmhub API.

   a. First, install ``curl`` and ``jq``.

   b. Then, use Charmcraft to log in to Charmhub and export your Charmhub
      credentials / token (macaroon) to a file:

      .. code-block:: bash

          charmcraft login --export charmhub-creds.dat

   c. Next, decode and extract the macaroon from the .dat file and place it in a header
      in an environment variable:

      .. code-block:: bash

         export CHARMHUB_MACAROON_HEADER="Authorization: Macaroon $(cat charmhub-creds.dat | base64 -d | jq -r .v)"

      At this point you can use this variable in ``curl`` commands -- just make sure to
      specify the correct ``Content-Type``.

2. Use curl to view the existing guardrails and tracks.** To view the guardrails and
   tracks associated with your charm, issue an HTTP ``GET`` request to
   ``/v1/<namespace>/<name>``. For example, for a charm named ``hello-world-charm``:

   .. code-block:: bash

       curl https://api.charmhub.io/v1/charm/hello-world-charm -H'Content-type: application/json' -H "$CHARMHUB_MACAROON_HEADER"

   The guardrails and tracks of the package will be under the ``track-guardrails``
   and ``tracks`` keys of ``metadata``. Now you know what the new track may look like.

    See more: `Charmhub API docs > package\_metadata
    <https://api.charmhub.io/docs/default.html#package_metadata>`_

   .. important::

       If you want to view the guardrails and tracks for all published charms,Issue an
       HTTP ``GET`` request to ``/v1/<namespace>``, as below.

       .. code-block:: bash

           curl https://api.charmhub.io/v1/charm -H'Content-type: application/json' -H "$CHARMHUB_MACAROON_HEADER"

       See more: `Charmhub API docs > list_registered_names
       <https://api.charmhub.io/docs/default.html#list_registered_names>`_.


3. Use ``curl`` to create a new track. Finally, to create a new track for your
   charm, issue an HTTP ``POST`` request to ``/v1/<namespace>/<name>/tracks``,
   where ``name`` and ``namespace`` refer to the name and type of the package
   respectively. For example, given a charm named ``hello-world-charm``, one can
   create two tracks ``v.1`` and ``v.2`` as follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

        curl https://api.charmhub.io/v1/charm/hello-world-charm/tracks -X POST -H'Content-type: application/json' -H "$CHARMHUB_MACAROON_HEADER" -d '[{"name": "v.1"}, {"name": "v.2"}]'

   Of course, the tracks must conform to the existing guardrail for the charm.

       See more: `Charmhub API docs > create_tracks
       <https://api.charmhub.io/docs/default.html#create_tracks>`_

That's it, you now have a new track for your charm!
