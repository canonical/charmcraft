Dependencies
------------

This plugin creates a Python virtual environment in the ``venv`` directory of your
charm using the version of Python included with your base and the requirements files
provided in the ``python-requirements`` key.

.. note::
   The python plugin prevents :command:`pip` from installing dependencies for the
   required packages. Therefore, requirements must include indirect dependencies as
   well as direct dependencies. It is recommended that you use a tool such as
   :command:`pip-compile` or :command:`uv` to manage the contents of your
   ``requirements.txt`` file.

How it works
------------

During the build step, the plugin performs the following actions:

1. It creates a virtual environment in the
   :ref:`${CRAFT_PART_INSTALL}/venv <craft_parts_step_execution_environment>`
   directory.
2. It uses :command:`pip` to install the required Python packages specified
   by the ``python-requirements``, ``python-constraints`` and ``python-packages``
   keys.
4. It copies any existing ``src`` and ``lib`` directories from your charm project into
   the final charm.

Example
-------

The following ``charmcraft.yaml`` file can be used with a standard charm structure
to build a charm for Ubuntu 24.04:

.. literalinclude:: python-charmcraft.yaml
   :language: yaml
