The `LICENSE` file is the file where you specify the license you want to use for your charm.

Charmcraft pre-populates the LICENSE file with the [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) license. Before publication, it is important that you consider the implications of this and select a license appropriate for your use case. If youâ€™re not sure which license to select, [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) can help you. For most charms, we recommend [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), as this will allow for simple modification, redistribution, and packaging by the Charmhub community.
