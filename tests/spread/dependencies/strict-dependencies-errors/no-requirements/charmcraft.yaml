title: Strict dependencies test charm
summary: a test charm for checking that strict dependencies are used.
description: |
  This charm fails to build because strict dependencies are enabled and no
  requirements file is provided. In the unlikely scenario where a charm author
  chooses to enable strict dependencies but does not need extra packages, an empty
  requirements.txt file should be created in the same directory as the charm.
